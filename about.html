<center><p> was the little girl who dreamt of Eating Cake for Breakfast!

    Watching my grandmother whip up cakes on family birthdays’ was always a pleasure. Get-togethers of family & friends would get me excited and I would bake up a storm!
    
    I started Sugaries to bring homemade goodness to the Karachi folk with special touches of finesse as a young baker & pastry chef. My baking was fuelled with passion and love for all goodies bearing wholesome goodness.
    
    I believe in a simple motto. Quality products beat everything. My bakery prepares hand-crafted, fresh, and top quality products. Thereafter, added are the sparks of magic and sprinkles of creativity by my qualified and dedicated kitchen team. My mission is simply to provide happiness through my creations.
    
    Our edible works of art are served at Sugaries daily. Not only are they visually stunning but extremely delicious.
    
    Our product range includes freshly baked layer cakes, cupcakes, cookies, brownies, desserts, savouries and a wide selection of breads. At Sugaries we are serving treats for everyone
